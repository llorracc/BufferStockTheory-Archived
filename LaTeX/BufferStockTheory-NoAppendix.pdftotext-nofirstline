Theoretical Foundations of
Buffer Stock Saving
October 4, 2020

Christopher D. Carroll1

Abstract
This paper builds theoretical foundations for rigorous and intuitive understanding of ‘buffer
stock’ saving models, pairing each theoretical result with a quantitative exploration. After
describing conditions under which the consumption function converges, the paper shows that
a ‘target’ buffer stock exists only under conditions strictly stronger than those that guarantee
convergence of the consumption and value functions. It also shows that the average growth
rate of consumption equals the average growth rate of permanent income (in a small open
economy populated by buffer stock savers). Together, the (provided) numerical tools and
(proven) analytical results constitute a comprehensive toolkit for understanding buffer stock
models.

1 Introduction
In the presence of empirically realistic transitory and permanent shocks to income a
la Friedman (1957), only one other ingredient is required to define a testable model of
optimal consumption: A description of preferences. Modelers usually assume geometric
discounting of a constant relative risk aversion (CRRA) utility function, because, starting
with Zeldes (1989), a large literature has shown that models of this kind have quantitative
predictions that can match microeconomic evidence reasonably well.
A companion theoretical literature has shown that standard numerical solution methods provide good approximations to limiting “true” mathematical solutions – but only
for models more complex than the simple case with just shocks and utility. The extra
complexity has been required because standard contraction mapping theorems (beginning with Bellman (1957) and including those following Stokey et. al. (1989)) cannot be
applied when the utility function is unbounded (like CRRA - see section 2.1).1
This paper’s first technical contribution is to articulate the (surprisingly loose) conditions under which the simple problem (without convenient shortcuts like a consumption
floor or liquidity constraints) defines a contraction mapping with a nondegenerate consumption function (the main requirement is a ‘Finite Value of Autarky’ condition).
Another contribution is to specify the conditions under which the resulting consumption
function implies there is a ‘target’ wealth-to-permanent-income ratio (so the model
exhibits ‘buffer stock’ saving behavior.) The key requirement for existence of a target
is that the model’s parameters satisfy a “Growth Impatience Condition” (equation (34))
that relates preferences and uncertainty to the predictable growth rate of income.
Even without a formal proof, target saving of this kind has been intuitively understood
to underlie central numerical results from the heterogeneous agent macroeconomics
literature; for example, the logic of target saving is central to the explanation by
Krueger, Mitman, and Perri (2016) of the fact that, during the Great Recession, middleclass consumers cut their consumption more than the poor or the rich. The theoretical
logic articulated below explains this finding: Learning that the future has become more
uncertain does not change the urgent imperatives of the poor (their high u0 (c)) because
they have little room to maneuver. Increased labor income uncertainty does not change
the behavior of the rich because the increase in uncertainty does not threaten their
consumption much. Only people in the middle have both the motivation and the wiggleroom to reduce their discretionary spending.
Conveniently, elements required for the convergence proof turn out to provide analytical foundations for many other results that have become familiar from the numerical
1 It is unclear whether newer methods such as those of Matkowski and Nowak (2011) could overcome this problem,
or how difficult it would be to do so; but in any case this particular problem does not seem to have been tackled by those
methods or any others.

literature. All theoretical conclusions are paired with numerically computed illustrations
(using an open-source toolkit available from the Econ-ARK project). All of the insights
of this paper are instantiated in the toolkit, which algorithmically flags parametric
choices under which a problem fails to define a contraction mapping, under which a
target level of wealth does not exist, or under which the solution is otherwise degenerate.
Thus, the theoretical foundations provided here are valuable both because they provide
intuition about the determinants of saving targets, and because they make it easier to
develop reliable numerical solution methods (by providing tight restrictions that valid
solutions must satisfy).
The paper proceeds in three parts.
The first part articulates the conditions required for the problem to define a unique
nondegenerate limiting consumption function, and discusses the relation of the paper’s
model to models previously considered in the literature. The required conditions are
interestingly parallel to those required for the liquidity constrained perfect foresight
model; that parallel is explored and explained. Next, the paper derives some limiting
properties of the consumption function as cash approaches infinity and as it approaches
its lower bound, and the theorem is proven explaining when the problem defines a
contraction mapping. Finally, a related class of commonly-used models (exemplified by
Deaton (1991)) is shown to constitute a particular limit of this paper’s more general
model.
The next section examines five key properties of the model. First, as cash approaches
infinity the expected growth rate of consumption and the marginal propensity to consume (MPC) converge to their values in the perfect foresight case. Second, as cash
approaches zero the expected growth rate of consumption approaches infinity, and the
MPC approaches a simple analytical limit. Third, if the consumer is ‘growth impatient,’
a unique target cash-to-permanent-income ratio will exist. Fourth, at the target cash
ratio, the expected growth rate of consumption is slightly less than the expected growth
rate of permanent noncapital income. Finally, the expected growth rate of consumption
is declining in the level of cash. The first four propositions are proven under general
assumptions about parameter values; the last is shown to hold if there are no transitory
shocks, but may fail in extreme cases if there are both transitory and permanent shocks.
Szeidl (2012) has shown that such an economy will be characterized by stable invariant
distributions for the consumption ratio, the wealth ratio, and other variables.2 Using
Szeidl’s result, the final section discusses conditions under which, even with a fixed
aggregate interest rate that differs from the time preference rate, an economy populated
by buffer stock consumers converges to a balanced growth equilibrium in which the
growth rate of consumption tends toward the (exogenous) growth rate of permanent
income.

2 Szeidl’s proof supplants the analysis in an earlier draft of this paper, which conjectured that such a result held and
provided supportive simulation evidence.

2 The Problem
2.1 Setup
The consumer solves an optimization problem from period t until the end of life at T
defined by the objective
" T −t

n=0

where
u(•) = •1−ρ /(1 − ρ)

(2)

is a constant relative risk aversion utility function with ρ > 1.3 , 4 The consumer’s initial
condition is defined by market resources mt (which Deaton (1991) called ‘cash-on-hand’)
and permanent noncapital income pt .
In the usual treatment, a dynamic budget constraint (DBC) simultaneously incorporates all of the elements that determine next period’s m given this period’s choices; but
for the detailed analysis here, it will be useful to disarticulate the steps so that individual
ingredients can be separately examined:
at = mt − ct
bt+1 = at R
pt+1 = pt Γψt+1
| {z }

(3)

≡Γt+1

mt+1 = bt+1 + pt+1 ξt+1 ,
where at indicates the consumer’s assets at the end of period t, which grow by a fixed
interest factor R = (1 + r) between periods,5 so that bt+1 is the consumer’s financial
(‘bank’) balances before next period’s consumption choice;6 mt+1 (‘market resources’ or
‘money’) is the sum of financial wealth bt+1 and noncapital income pt+1 ξt+1 (permanent
noncapital income pt+1 multiplied by a mean-one iid transitory income shock factor
ξt+1 ; future transitory shocks are assumed to satisfy Et [ξt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1). Permanent
noncapital income in period t + 1 is equal to its previous value, multiplied by a growth
factor Γ, modified by a mean-one iid shock ψt+1 , Et [ψt+n ] = 1 ∀ n ≥ 1 satisfying

3 The main results also hold for logarithmic utility which is the limit as ρ → 1 but incorporating the logarithmic
special case in the proofs is cumbersome and therefore omitted.
4 We will define the infinite horizon solution as the limit of the finite horizon problem as the horizon T − t approaches
infinity.
5 See Ma, Stachurski, and Toda (2018) for interesting new work that considers the case where capital returns are
stochastic and liquidity constraints exist. Benhabib, Bisin, and Zhu (2015) examines implications of capital income risk
for the distribution of wealth.
6 Allowing a stochastic interest factor is straightforward but adds little insight. The effects are more interesting for
analysis of the invariant distribution (Szeidl (2012)).

7 It is useful to emphasize that permanent noncapital income as defined here differs from what Deaton (1992) calls
permanent income (which is often adopted in the macro literature). Deaton defines permanent income as the amount
that a perfect foresight consumer could spend while leaving total (human and nonhuman) wealth constant. Relatedly, we
refer to mt as ‘cash-on-hand’ or ‘market resources’ rather than as wealth to avoid any confusion for readers accustomed
to thinking of the discounted value of future noncapital income as a part of wealth. The ‘market resources’ terminology
is motivated by the model’s assumption that human wealth cannot be capitalized, an implication of anti-slavery laws.
