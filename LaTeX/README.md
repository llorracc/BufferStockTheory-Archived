# LaTeX Generated Files

In its processing of its raw inputs (basically, computer programs), LaTeX generates
a great many auxiliary files. The default is for these to be deposited in the same
directory as the ".tex" file being processed, but that generates a great deal of
clutter. If LaTeX is properly configured (or invoked), it can be made to put all
generated files here.
