The diagrams below illustrate the order of the several conditions in the text:
PF-GIC
Þ
Γ
RIC

FHWC
R

FHWC

R1/ρ Γ1−1/ρ

and to further incorporate the Perfect Foresight Finite Value of Autarky Condition:
PF-GIC
Þ
Γ
RIC

PF-FVAC

FHWC

R1/ρ Γ1−1/ρ
FHWC
In both diagrams, an arrow means “<”, which indicates the annotated condition holds,
so if a condition is violated, the corresponding arrow is to be reversed. These diagrams
also keep track of the hierarchy among the conditions. For example, if the right vertical
arrow in the second diagram is reversed, then the top right triangle says PF-FVAC+
 + PF-GIC

 implies PF-GIC. If the left vertical arrow is reversed, then 
FHWC
RIC



implies 
FHWC.
